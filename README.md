## Overview
Welcome to the HR Analytics project! This project delves into Human Resources data to gain valuable insights and answer important business questions related to employee performance, satisfaction, and absenteeism. The analysis is conducted in R, utilizing various statistical models and data visualization techniques.

## Data
The HR data used in this analysis is sourced from "HRanalytics.xlsx" and contains information about employees, including their performance scores, satisfaction levels, salary, department, manager, recruitment source, and more.

## R Code
The heart of this project lies in the "HR Analytics r file," where you'll find the entire codebase for data import, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and modeling. The code is extensively documented to help you understand each step of the analysis.

## Business Questions
This project seeks to answer several crucial business questions:

1. **Top Predictors:** Identifies the top three predictors that most significantly affect employee performance, satisfaction, and absenteeism, while controlling for other variables.

2. **Manager and Department Impact:** Explores the relationships between managers, departments, and employee performance and satisfaction scores, highlighting the best and worst-performing managers and departments.

3. **Recruitment Source Influence:** Examines how the recruitment source affects employee performance and satisfaction, revealing the highest and lowest-performing sources and quantifying the differences.

4. **Employee Retention:** Estimates the probability of employees continuing to work in various departments after 5 years.

5. **Pay Equity Analysis:** Investigates whether pay inequities exist based on race or gender within the company's departments and assesses how these inequities impact performance and satisfaction.

## Models
This project utilizes a range of statistical models, including ordered logistic regression, Tobit models, Poisson regression, and Negative Binomial regression, to provide insights into the relationships between variables and employee outcomes.

## Results
The project's results are presented within the R code file, with detailed summaries, statistical analyses, and model outputs provided for each business question. Visualizations and graphs are included to enhance data interpretation.

## Limitations
- Certain models had issues with convergence or assumptions, leading to the exploration of alternative modeling approaches, such as Tobit models.
- Interpretation of odds ratios in some models may be challenging due to infinite or very large values.

## Conclusion
HR Analytics offers valuable insights into the factors influencing employee performance, satisfaction, and absenteeism. By addressing key business questions, this project helps HR professionals and decision-makers make informed choices, improve workplace conditions, and foster a more productive and satisfied workforce.
